# Click Configs

This is a bundle of useful click configs to the uniprobe project ðŸ¦„. To add your own, do so via pull request so that file prefixes can be best managed.

Some prefixed files might be the same as another non-prefixed file, however, the prefixes should help maintain test reproducibility over time.

### Current Prefixes

> Structure is: `prefix_file-name.click`

- `NO PREFIX`: does not directly link to a specific project
- `um`: is a config for the testing of unimon
